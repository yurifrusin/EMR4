## Review Request

Sprint 55 dispatched: Bernie dev review fixture route

## Worker Completion Notes

Required before submit. These notes are copied into Codex's review packet automatically:

- Files changed:
  - NEW `app/routers/bernie_dev.py` — dev-gated router at `/api/v1/appointments/dev`;
    one endpoint `GET /api/v1/appointments/dev/bernie-review-fixtures` returning
    deterministic non-PHI `BernieSupervisedBookingOut` fixtures keyed by state (blocked /
    candidate_selection_required / confirmation_ready); optional `?state=` query filter
    returns a single-key dict for that state; gated via a `_require_dev_environment`
    router-level dependency (404 in non-dev); auth required (`get_current_user`);
    no DB writes, no audit rows, no LLM imports; `staff_review` built via the live
    `_bernie_staff_review_payload` helper imported from `app.routers.appointments` so
    the fixture contract tracks the live wrapper output; `confirm_endpoint` is
    `/api/v1/appointments/proposals/create/confirm-bernie` and `confirm_payload.confirmed`
    is `False` (not yet explicitly staff-approved); fixtures built once at module import
    time using sentinel UUIDs in the `f170000000xx` range.
  - EDIT `app/main.py` — import and include `bernie_dev.router` (already present from draft).
  - NEW `tests/test_bernie_dev_fixtures.py` — 16 tests covering: auth gate (401),
    dev-only gate (404 in production via monkeypatch), 200 in dev, all-three-states
    default response, per-state structure assertions (blocked/candidate/confirmation),
    exact `confirm_endpoint` value assertion, `confirm_payload.confirmed is False` assertion,
    parametrized state filter (all 3 valid states + 422 for invalid), no-write proof
    (Appointment + AppointmentAuditLog row counts unchanged), no-LLM-import proof
    (source inspection), non-PHI proof (pattern scan), and determinism check.

- Verification run:
  - `py_compile app/routers/bernie_dev.py app/main.py tests/test_bernie_dev_fixtures.py` → OK
  - `pytest tests/test_bernie_dev_fixtures.py -v` → 16 passed
  - `pytest tests/ -k bernie -v` → 75 passed (all Bernie wrapper/review/confirm/normalizer/harness tests)
  - `git diff --check` → clean (CRLF line-ending note on packet file only — not a code issue)

- Remaining risks:
  - The `_ALL_FIXTURES` dict is module-level (built at import). If any schema validator
    changes the `SlotSearchProposalIn` date-range or field rules in a way that rejects
    the fixture values, `bernie_dev.py` will fail to import. Unlikely given the fixture
    uses fixed future dates and standard field values.
  - Fixture UUIDs (`f17000000001`–`f17000000004`) are sentinel values that do not exist
    in the DB; the route never queries them, so no DB lookup failures possible. If a
    future route change adds DB lookups to this endpoint, the sentinel IDs will return
    404-equivalent DB misses.
  - `monkeypatch.setattr(bernie_dev_module.settings, "environment", "production")` works
    because `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` is not frozen by default. If `Settings` is
    ever marked `frozen=True`, the env-gate test will need a different approach.
  - `_bernie_staff_review_payload` is imported directly from the private module namespace
    of `app.routers.appointments`. If it is ever renamed, `bernie_dev.py` will break at
    import time with a clear `ImportError`.

## Required Review Steps

1. Fetch the worker branch.
2. Inspect `orchestration/agent_inbox/claude/claude-bernie-dev-review-fixture-route.md`.
3. Review the branch diff against `master`.
4. Run the verification listed in the source task or explain why not.
5. Integrate only if the work is correct, scoped, and compatible with current baton.
