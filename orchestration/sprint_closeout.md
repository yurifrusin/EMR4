# EMR4 Sprint Closeout

This file tracks what the user should review after each integrated sprint batch
of parallel-agent work. Codex updates it after submitted work has been polled,
reviewed, integrated, verified, pushed, and audited.

## Current Closeout

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Batch | Sprint 24: Appointment Edit Proposal Flow |
| Integrated through | Sprint 24 backend proposal hardening and diary edit proposal preflight |
| Status | Integrated locally; push, mirror realignment, audit, and residual live review pending |
| Last updated | 2026-06-24 |

## What Changed

- Backend `POST /appointments/proposals/update/{appointment_id}` now blocks explicit practitioner removal with `practitioner_required` instead of letting a safe proposal produce a later failing write.
- Backend update proposals now block loss of all patient identity with `patient_identity_required`, while still allowing a linked appointment to become a provisional-name booking when the provisional name is supplied.
- Seven focused backend tests cover null practitioner, null patient identity, null-plus-provisional downgrade, cross-practice/nonexistent appointments, empty-body reflection, and valid practitioner reassignment.
- Diary edit/reschedule saves now preflight `POST /appointments/proposals/update/{id}` before the real `PUT`, matching the existing create-proposal block/warning/Confirm & Save flow.
- Diary smoke-mode conflict checks exclude the appointment currently being edited, so saving without changing slot no longer self-conflicts.
- Diary frontend asset cache-bust moved to `diary.js?v=85` / `diary.css?v=85`.
- No schema migration, taskpane, Command Centre, patient demographics, Resource Administration, Waiting Room layout, drag/drop, resize, or Bernie runtime changes were made.

## Recommended User Review

Residual user review/testing after push/deploy: one short live diary edit smoke
is useful because this sprint changes the real appointment edit modal and
Ariadne could verify static/frontend checks but not a live GitHub Pages
Office-dialog edit flow in this thread. Confirm `diary.js?v=85` is loaded, then
exercise one safe edit, one blocked edit, and one warning-confirm edit.

Detailed steps for Yuri-only review:

1. Hard refresh the live diary/Office-dialog surface and confirm `diary.js?v=85`
   and `diary.css?v=85` are loaded.
2. Sign in as a normal staff/admin-capable user who can edit diary appointments.
3. Pick an existing appointment, open its edit modal, make a harmless edit such
   as changing notes/details without moving the time, then save. Expected: no
   self-conflict block appears, the appointment saves, and the diary reloads.
4. Reopen the same appointment and move it to overlap another appointment for
   the same practitioner/resource. Expected: save is blocked before write with
   readable overlap/error copy; after closing/reloading, the original
   appointment time remains unchanged.
5. Reopen or create an edit scenario that crosses a configured break such as
   morning tea or lunch. Expected: warning copy appears, the primary button
   changes to `Confirm & Save`, and no write occurs on the first click.
6. While the warning is visible, change a field such as time/duration/patient.
   Expected: the confirmation state resets to ordinary `Save Booking`.
7. Trigger the break-warning path again and click `Confirm & Save`. Expected:
   the appointment saves, the diary reloads, and the edit is visible after
   refresh.
8. Report whether v85 loaded, whether safe edits avoided self-conflict, whether
   blocked edits prevented writes, whether warning confirmation reset correctly,
   and screenshots for anything suspicious.

## Not Required Before Moving On

- No database migration or manual data repair is required.
- No Word taskpane, Command Centre, patient-file, Resource Administration,
  Waiting Room pane layout, drag/drop, resize, status mutation, duplicate-audit,
  or clinical workflow review is required for this sprint.
- No security or dependency remediation is required; production `npm audit --omit=dev` remains clean and Bandit medium+/high checks passed.

## Known Follow-Up

- The broad backend suite was not rerun after integration because interrupted
  pytest runs left the test database in a partial enum state; Ariadne reset
  `gp_pms_test.public` and reran the targeted Sprint 24 proposal tests. Treat
  broad-suite runtime/test-DB resilience as a separate dev-tooling follow-up.
- The live diary edit modal should be smoke-tested after Pages serves v85 because
  static checks cannot fully prove the real Office-dialog/browser interaction.
- The existing `pytest_asyncio` fixture-loop-scope warning remains a future test-hygiene item.

## Verification

- `.\scripts\check_backend.ps1` -> passed; compileall, Bandit medium+/high scan, and whitespace check all green.
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_appointment_update_proposal.py -q --tb=short -p no:randomly` -> passed; 19 passed, 1 existing pytest-asyncio deprecation warning, after resetting an interrupted `gp_pms_test` schema.
- `node --check docs\diary\diary.js` -> passed.
- `npm run validate-all` in `EMR4 Sidebar` -> passed; manifest valid, production npm audit clean, frontend asset/version check passed. Local/HEAD diary assets are v85; deployed Pages was still v84 before push.
- `git diff --check` -> passed.
- Worker-reported smoke-mode edit proposal checks passed for warning rendering, save buttons, and self-conflict exclusion.

## Recommended Next Direction

1. After Pages serves v85, run the short live edit-proposal smoke above.
2. If the smoke is clean, continue Programme 2B toward the next safe appointment mutation slice: likely status/waiting-area proposal retrofit or drag/reschedule design groundwork.
3. Keep sprints grouped under Programme 2B so the project advances by coherent appointment-mutation capability rather than isolated micro-tasks.

## Previous Closeout - Sprint 23

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Batch | Sprint 23: Room Default Waiting-Area Invariant |
| Integrated through | Sprint 23 waiting-area invariant integration |
| Status | Integrated, pushed, mirrored, audited, and awaiting optional live Admin smoke |
| Last updated | 2026-06-24 |

## What Changed

- Backend resource-admin room writes now enforce the active-room default waiting-area invariant where possible: room creation auto-selects the lowest-order compatible active waiting area, explicit null on active rooms resolves to a fallback, and reactivating a room fills a fallback.
- Archiving a waiting area now reassigns active rooms that used it to the next compatible active fallback, or clears the default only when no compatible active waiting area remains.
- Resource Administration room cards now show explicit/fallback default waiting-area labels, room forms preselect active defaults/fallbacks, and smoke-mode waiting-area archive behavior mirrors reassignment.
- Diary frontend asset cache-bust moved to `diary.js?v=84` / `diary.css?v=84`.
- No schema migration, taskpane, Command Centre, patient, appointment booking, or clinical-document changes were made.

## Recommended User Review

Residual user review/testing after push/deploy: one short live diary smoke is
useful because this sprint changes the Resource Administration UI and the real
Office dialog/GitHub Pages surface can reveal deployment or browser-state issues
that static checks cannot. Confirm `diary.js?v=84` is loaded, open Admin ->
Resource Administration, and check that room default waiting areas are visible,
preselected in the room form, and remain coherent after archiving a waiting area.

Detailed steps for Yuri-only review:

1. Hard refresh the live diary/Office-dialog surface and confirm `diary.js?v=84`
   and `diary.css?v=84` are loaded.
2. Sign in as an Admin or PracticeOwner-capable user.
3. Open `⚙️ Admin` -> `Resource Administration` -> `Rooms`.
4. Confirm every active room card displays an explicit or fallback default
   waiting area when active waiting areas exist.
5. Edit one room, confirm the default waiting-area dropdown is preselected, then
   cancel and confirm no state changed.
6. Edit the same room again, change the default waiting area, save, close and
   reopen Resource Administration, and confirm the saved default persists.
7. Open `Waiting Areas`, archive a non-critical active waiting area, and confirm
   affected rooms now show another compatible active fallback or no default only
   when no active fallback exists.
8. Reopen the right-side Waiting Room pane and confirm its tabs match active
   waiting areas and exclude archived areas.
9. Skip non-admin denial if the taskpane cannot be resized or logged out safely;
   report that as an accessibility blocker rather than spending time fighting
   the UI.
10. Report whether v84 loaded, whether defaults displayed/preselected correctly,
   whether archive reassignment looked coherent, and screenshots for anything
   suspicious.

## Not Required Before Moving On

- No database migration or manual data repair is required for dev data; existing null active-room defaults are repaired on create/update/archive paths where compatible active areas exist.
- No Word taskpane, Command Centre, patient-file, appointment create/edit, status, duplicate-audit, or clinical workflow review is required for this sprint.
- No security or dependency remediation is required; production `npm audit --omit=dev` remains clean and Bandit medium+/high checks passed.

## Known Follow-Up

- The frontend fallback helper operates over the waiting areas currently loaded for the active location. The backend invariant is authoritative and includes compatible practice-wide areas; consider a later UI/API refinement if practice-wide waiting areas become a real configuration path.
- The broad `python -m pytest tests/` run timed out during Ariadne verification without a failure report. Sprint-targeted resource-admin/waiting-room tests passed; investigate broad-suite runtime/hanging separately rather than blocking this narrow integration.
- Taskpane logout is currently hard to reach when the pane cannot be widened:
  Yuri could not test non-admin Resource Administration denial because the
  logout button sits at the extreme right and the resize affordance was blocked
  by an hourglass cursor. Add a future UI/accessibility task to make logout and
  role-switching reachable without relying on taskpane width.
- The existing `pytest_asyncio` fixture-loop-scope warning remains a future test-hygiene item.

## Verification

- `.\scripts\check_backend.ps1` -> passed; compileall, Bandit medium+/high scan, and whitespace check all green.
- `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_diary_resource_admin.py tests\test_waiting_room.py -q --tb=short -p no:randomly` -> passed; 61 passed, 1 existing pytest-asyncio deprecation warning.
- `node --check docs\diary\diary.js` -> passed.
- `npm run validate-all` in `EMR4 Sidebar` -> passed; manifest valid, production npm audit clean, frontend asset/version check passed. Local/HEAD diary assets are v84; deployed Pages was still v83 before push.
- `git diff --check` -> passed.
- Worker-reported full backend suite on Claude branch passed before integration; Ariadne's post-merge broad full-suite attempt timed out without a failure report and is recorded as a follow-up rather than a blocker.

## Recommended Next Direction

1. After Pages serves v84, run the short live Admin smoke above; if clean, proceed to the next product-growth sprint.
2. Plan the next architecture/dev-tooling optimisation sprint around automating the browser smoke checks Ariadne has been doing manually.
3. Keep the room/waiting-area model steady: every active room should have an active default area where possible, with display-order-zero as the natural fallback.

## Sprint 15 Review Harness - Waiting Room Check-In Operations

Use this section after the Sprint 15 backend and diary UI worker branches are
reviewed and integrated. It is a user-review harness, not evidence that the
implementation has already landed.

### Design Guardrails

- A **Waiting Area** is a named physical place where arrived patients wait.
- A **Room** is a physical consult/procedure room. It may have a default waiting
  area, but it is not itself a waiting area.
- A **Practitioner** is the bookable clinician/resource for the appointment.
- **Attendance status** is same-day workflow: Booked, Arrived/Waiting,
  InConsult, Completed, Cancelled, NoShow, or DNA.
- **Booking confirmation** is the patient's intention/response to attend and is
  separate from attendance status.
- **Patient identity** should be described as **Verified** or **Unverified**.
  Do not use "Confirmed" for identity; reserve it for booking attendance intent
  or legacy appointment status only when clearly qualified.
- Bernie may execute deterministic, low-risk operational actions with audit and
  reporting, such as an unambiguous check-in/status correction. Slot selection,
  booking choice, rescheduling, externally consequential actions, clinical
  actions, and ambiguous identity cases still require staff confirmation.
- Any future request for "stacking" must specify the surface:
  **Waiting Room cards** inside the side panel, or **diary appointment blocks**
  on the room/time grid. These are different layout problems and should not be
  changed together by default.

### Manual User Review Checklist

1. Pull latest, restart the backend, rerun `python seed.py`, and hard refresh
   the deployed/local diary surface. Confirm the diary loads `diary.js?v=68`.
2. Open today's diary and the Waiting Room panel. Confirm Expected Today cards
   are compact, chronological by appointment time, and readable without looking
   like the main diary grid's overlapping appointment blocks.
3. Confirm ordinary diary appointment blocks on the room/time grid still use
   their existing time geometry. The Sprint 15 Waiting Room work must not
   introduce appointment-block stacking/cascade changes in the main diary grid.
4. Check in an appointment from Expected Today without manually selecting a
   waiting area when the appointment's room has a default. Confirm the patient
   appears in the correct/default Waiting Area section and the appointment
   detail shows that area consistently.
5. Check in an appointment while explicitly selecting a non-default waiting
   area. Confirm the explicit choice wins over the room default and survives a
   refresh.
6. If the UI supports changing the waiting area after arrival, move an arrived
   patient to another waiting area. Confirm the patient moves sections without
   changing practitioner, room, appointment time, or patient identity state.
7. Move a checked-in patient through Waiting/Arrived -> InConsult -> Completed.
   Confirm Waiting Room sections update immediately and after refresh:
   Waiting/Arrived patients are active in their area, InConsult patients appear
   only in the in-consult section, and Completed patients appear only in the
   finished/terminal section if that section is displayed.
8. Set terminal statuses Cancelled, NoShow, and DNA on appointments that had a
   waiting area. Confirm they do not remain incorrectly visible in active
   Waiting Area sections. If the backend preserves `waiting_area_id` for
   history, the active UI must still filter terminal statuses out of active
   waiting lists.
9. Test a practice/day with exactly one active waiting area. Confirm the UI does
   not show a clipped, fake, or confusing tab strip; the single area should read
   as the natural context rather than a broken multi-tab control.
10. Test an Unverified/provisional appointment if available. Check-in may be
    allowed, but the UI should not imply that arrival verified the patient
    identity. The displayed language should keep identity verification separate
    from attendance.

### Backend / API Spot Checks

Use these only after getting a staff JWT and real IDs from the dev database or
browser network panel. Route names may need the `/api/v1` prefix depending on
the caller base URL.

```powershell
$base = "http://localhost:8001/api/v1"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer <JWT>" }
$appointmentId = "<appointment-uuid>"
$waitingAreaId = "<waiting-area-uuid>"

# Explicit check-in to a waiting area.
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Patch `
  -Uri "$base/appointments/$appointmentId/status" `
  -Headers $headers `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body (@{ status = "Arrived"; waiting_area_id = $waitingAreaId } | ConvertTo-Json)

# Default/no explicit waiting area path. Verify this follows the integrated
# backend contract: either room default assignment or existing assignment
# preservation, as specified by the Sprint 15 backend worker.
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Patch `
  -Uri "$base/appointments/$appointmentId/status" `
  -Headers $headers `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body (@{ status = "Arrived" } | ConvertTo-Json)

# Terminal status should not leave the patient visible in active waiting areas.
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Patch `
  -Uri "$base/appointments/$appointmentId/status" `
  -Headers $headers `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body (@{ status = "Completed"; waiting_area_id = $null } | ConvertTo-Json)
```

API review expectations:

- Cross-practice or inactive `waiting_area_id` values are rejected.
- Explicit `waiting_area_id = null` clears the appointment's waiting area when
  the contract allows clearing.
- Moving to InConsult, Completed, Cancelled, NoShow, or DNA does not strand the
  patient in active waiting-area feeds.
- Status transitions do not link a provisional patient to a real patient record,
  do not change booking confirmation state, and do not alter practitioner/room
  assignment unless a separate explicit endpoint says so.

### Sprint 15 Review Questions For Codex/Orchestrator

- Did Claude's backend branch make terminal-status clearing explicit, or does it
  preserve `waiting_area_id` for history while filtering in the waiting-room
  endpoint/UI?
- Did Antigravity keep Expected Today compacting scoped to Waiting Room cards
  only, with no diary-grid appointment geometry changes?
- Does the single-waiting-area state read naturally, or should the next UI slice
  replace tabs with a simple heading/count when only one active area exists?
- Are there audit hooks yet for Bernie-style direct check-in/status execution?
  If not, keep Bernie write tools at proposal/report level or limit execution to
  the already validated route behaviour.

## Sprint 16 Review Harness - Location-Aware Diary Foundations

Use `orchestration/location_diary_view_review.md` after the Sprint 16 backend
and diary UI worker branches are reviewed and integrated. This closeout pointer
is intentionally brief; the harness file owns the vocabulary table, backend
integration review, diary UI review, Bernie tool vocabulary, manual user review,
API spot checks, and merge gate.

Codex/orchestrator should specifically report whether:

- Backend location scoping keeps practice tenancy separate from physical
  location scoping.
- Rooms, waiting areas, diary templates, rosters, and appointments are
  associated with a physical location or have a deliberate safe fallback.
- The diary UI exposes the active physical location when there is more than one
  site, while the one-location case stays uncluttered.
- Diary page/view groups are treated as screen layout inside a location, not as
  extra locations.
- Waiting Room panels/cards, main diary appointment blocks, booking slots, and
  status controls remain separate review surfaces.
- Bernie tool language requires explicit location/resource context before any
  future write proposal.

---

## Sprint 17 Review Harness - Command/Proposal Workflow Retrofit

Use `orchestration/command_proposal_review.md` after the Sprint 17 backend and
diary UI worker branches are reviewed and integrated. This closeout pointer is
intentionally brief; the harness file owns the command/proposal vocabulary,
integration checklist, expected response classes, and PowerShell snippets.

Codex/orchestrator should specifically report whether:

- Proposal endpoints are non-mutating and return typed commands for staff
  confirmation.
- Safe create proposals still require staff confirmation before the diary is
  written.
- Conflict proposals return `safe=false`, `autonomy_tier=blocked`, and a stable
  `appointment_conflict` block without creating an appointment.
- Break overlaps and provisional patients return warnings, not blocks, and stay
  confirmable by staff.
- The diary UI treats blocked proposals as hard stops and warning proposals as
  explicit confirmation paths.
- Booking slots, diary grid cells, Waiting Room cards, appointment status, and
  patient identity are described as separate surfaces.
- No Sprint 17 work starts a Bernie runtime, bypasses normal appointment route
  validation, or creates a privileged agent-only write path.

### Sprint 17 Integrated Outcome

Integrated submissions:

- Claude: existing-appointment update/status proposal contracts.
- Antigravity: diary new-booking modal create-proposal preflight.
- Codex/Banach: command proposal review harness and API snippets.

Verification run after integration:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile app\routers\appointments.py app\schemas\appointments.py tests\test_appointment_update_proposal.py tests\test_appointment_proposals.py
node --check docs\diary\diary.js
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_appointment_update_proposal.py tests\test_appointment_proposals.py tests\test_appointment_status_mutations.py tests\test_booking_create_edit.py tests\test_break_overlap_contract.py -q --tb=short -p no:randomly
git diff --check
```

Result: `75 passed`; JS syntax and whitespace checks clean.

Manual user review:

- Confirm diary assets load at `diary.js?v=72`.
- Create a normal non-conflicting booking and confirm it saves.
- Try an overlapping booking and confirm the modal blocks the save before writing.
- Create a booking that crosses a break and confirm the warning appears, then `Confirm & Save` writes it.
- Create a provisional-patient booking and confirm the warning appears, then `Confirm & Save` writes it.
- Confirm the proposal warning/error copy is readable in the booking modal and does not disturb the main diary grid or Waiting Room panel.

User review result: positive after hotfix `d081834`; break-crossing warning now appears for the visible break path.
